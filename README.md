# MSE HTTP-DDS Bridge Project

**Author:** Joseph Mosalem  

## Description  
The **MSE HTTP-DDS Bridge Project** is a software tool that enables **seamless data exchange between HTTP-based clients and DDS (Data Distribution Service) pub-sub systems**. HTTP is a widely used web communication protocol, while DDS is a high-performance messaging standard for real-time distributed applications. This bridge application **translates JSON-based HTTP requests into DDS topics** and vice versa, ensuring efficient data flow across different computing environments.  

The project leverages an Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define data structures, allowing for automated code generation that simplifies and standardizes the translation process. The implementation primarily uses Python, integrating with FastDDS, a widely used open-source DDS implementation, and may utilize PYBIND11 to connect with C++ components.  

## Features  
- Converts JSON-formatted HTTP requests into DDS topics  
- Implements an IDL-based automated code generator  
- Supports FastDDS for DDS communication  
- Built-in error handling and logging for debugging  
- Designed for scalability and real-time performance 

## Installation  
Coming soon.  

## Usage
