# Project Plan: MSE HTTP-DDS Bridge

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### 1. **Project Planning & Setup**
   - Define project scope and objectives
   - Research DDS, HTTP, and IDL technologies
   - Set up project repository and development environment
   - Identify required tools and dependencies (FastDDS, Python, PYBIND11)
   - Establish Agile workflow and sprint structure

### 2. **HTTP Request Handling Implementation**
   - Develop a basic HTTP server in Python (Flask or FastAPI)
   - Implement endpoints for sending and receiving JSON requests
   - Validate incoming HTTP requests and handle errors
   - Create unit tests for HTTP request processing

### 3. **DDS Topic Management & Communication**
   - Set up FastDDS for DDS message exchange
   - Define DDS topic structures for data communication
   - Implement DDS publisher and subscriber logic
   - Establish QoS (Quality of Service) settings for reliability
   - Test DDS messaging functionality with sample data

### 4. **IDL-based Code Generation**
   - Design an Interface Definition Language (IDL) schema
   - Implement an IDL parser using ANTLR or another tool
   - Generate Python and C++ conversion code from IDL definitions
   - Integrate generated code into the bridge application
   - Validate data conversion between HTTP JSON and DDS topics

### 5. **Testing, Debugging, and Optimization**
   - Implement logging and debugging tools for monitoring errors
   - Conduct performance tests to minimize latency
   - Optimize serialization/deserialization for efficiency
   - Conduct end-to-end integration testing
   - Document API usage and deployment instructions

## Timeline & Next Steps
- Each key task will be broken down into **bi-weekly sprints** following Agile principles.
- Regular testing and debugging will be incorporated throughout development.
- The final deliverable will include a **working proof-of-concept** with documentation.
